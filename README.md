This is a beginner code for web scrapping.

The idea is to extract a data board from Wikipedia and transform it into a pandas data frame with all the data.

The data can then be used for transformation.

The first part of the code was done by [https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst](https://youtu.be/8dTpNajxaH0?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8G-xVXA5FxT2cLNzd87GInr),

The goal was really to learn how to do web scrapping.

The second part of code line 18 is where I tried to import different data using the code above to help me.
